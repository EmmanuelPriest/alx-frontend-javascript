## TYPESCRIPT
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing and other features to the language. With TypeScript, developers can catch errors earlier in the development process by providing type annotations for variables, function parameters, and return types. TypeScript also provides features such as classes, interfaces, and modules that make it easier to write and organize large-scale JavaScript applications. <br><br>
<em>TypeScript code can be compiled using the TypeScript compiler (tsc):</em> <br> <strong>tsc myfile.ts</strong> <br>
<h3>Here's a list of the basic types and their explanations:</h3><br>
<strong>number:</strong> represents both integer and floating-point numbers.<br>
<strong>string:</strong> represents a sequence of characters, enclosed in single or double quotes.<br>
<strong>boolean:</strong> represents a logical value, either true or false.<br>
<strong>null:</strong> represents the absence of any object value.<br>
<strong>undefined:</strong> represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.<br>
<strong>symbol:</strong> represents a unique identifier that can be used as a property key.<br>
any: represents any type, allowing you to opt-out of type checking and use dynamic typing.<br>
<strong>void</strong>: represents the absence of a value, typically used as the return type of a function that doesn't return anything. <br>
<h3. Interfaces </h3>
Interfaces: An interface in TypeScript defines a contract for an object that specifies the properties and methods that the object should have. <br>
<h3. Classes </h3>
Classes: A class in TypeScript is a blueprint for creating objects that encapsulate data and behavior. <br> 
<h3> Functions </h3>
Functions: Functions in TypeScript are similar to functions in JavaScript, but with added support for type checking and type inference. <br>
<h3> DOM And Typescript </h3>
Working with the DOM (Document Object Model) in TypeScript is very similar to working with it in JavaScript. The main difference is that TypeScript provides type checking and type inference to make it easier to work with the DOM and prevent common errors. <br>
<h3> Generic Types </h3>
Generic types in TypeScript allow you to write reusable code that works with a variety of types, without having to specify the exact type upfront. With generic types, you can write a function or a class that can work with any type of data, as long as that data meets certain requirements.<br>
<h3> Namespace </h3>
In TypeScript, a namespace is a way to group related code together, to avoid naming conflicts with other code that uses similar names. Namespaces provide a way to organize your code and make it easier to manage large codebases. <br>
<h3> Merge Declaration </h3>
In TypeScript, it is possible to merge multiple declarations for the same name into a single declaration, using declaration merging. This allows you to extend the behavior of an existing declaration without modifying the original code.<br>
<h3> Ambient Namespace </h3>
In TypeScript, an ambient namespace is a way to import an external library that does not provide TypeScript type definitions. It allows you to define the structure and types of the library in your code, without actually importing the library at runtime. <br>
<h3> Nominal Typing </h3>
Nominal typing is a type system in which the names of types are used to determine compatibility between values, rather than just their structure. In TypeScript, nominal typing can be achieved using a combination of interfaces and literal types.
