## ES6 data manipulation
JavaScript array is a type of object that can hold multiple values of any data type, including numbers, strings, objects, and even other arrays.
The map() method is used to transform every element of an array into a new array based on a provided callback function.
The filter() method is used to filter out elements from an array based on a provided condition in a callback function.
The reduce() method is used to reduce an array into a single value by executing a provided callback function on each element of the array.
typed arrays are a special type of array-like object designed to store and manipulate binary data more efficiently. They include:
Int8Array: 8-bit signed integer
Uint8Array: 8-bit unsigned integer
Uint8ClampedArray: 8-bit unsigned integer clamped to 0-255
Int16Array: 16-bit signed integer
Uint16Array: 16-bit unsigned integer
Int32Array: 32-bit signed integer
Uint32Array: 32-bit unsigned integer
Float32Array: 32-bit floating-point number
Float64Array: 64-bit floating-point number
A Set is a collection of unique values, meaning that each value can only appear once in the set.
A Map is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key can only appear once in the map.
A WeakMap is similar to a Map, but with a few key differences. The main difference is that keys in a WeakMap must be objects, and they are weakly held, which means that they can be garbage collected if there are no other references to them.
